This is the code for the Localonomy mobile apps!

## Prerequisites

First of, you will need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)) (the latest the version the better!).

You will also need to have [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) installed gloablly.

Then, run `npm install` (or `yarn`) to install all the dependencies

> You will also need a local version of the [API](https://github.com/localonomy/api) to be running on your machine for development!

## Running the code

To start the application, run:
`react-native run-ios`
or
`react-native run-android`

> Make sure you have the API running on `localhost:3000`.
> If you are using an Android emulator, please replace the IP address of your machine in `src/config/index.android.js`.
